-_-_-_-_-_ What changes did I already add to the Staging Area? -_-_-_-_-_-_-_

By adding the --staged (or alternatively: --cached) option, Git will show which local changes you have already added to Staging Area, via "git add":

- Staged changes in a certain file...
$ git diff --staged index.html

- Staged changes in all local files...
$ git diff --staged


-_-_-_-_-_ Navigate to older branch -_-_-_-_-_-_-_

$ git log --oneline

$ git checkout <commit-id> .

The previous command WITHOUT the dot "."
	it will take you to a new “detached head state” 
	where you can make changes and it will allow you to make commits, 
	but nothing will be saved and any commits you make will be lost.


The previous command WITH the dot "."
	you can make changes and commits and everything will be saved in a new branch
